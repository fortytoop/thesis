The Second Edition has been carefully updated and revised to reflect recent developments in the field and to further clarify the presentation of basic principles. Along with in-depth coverage of the fundamentals of plasma physics and chemistry, the authors apply basic theory to plasma discharges, including calculations of plasma parameters and the scaling of plasma parameters with control parameters. New and expanded topics include: Updated cross sections Diffusion and diffusion solutions Generalized Bohm criteria Expanded treatment of dc sheaths Langmuir probes in time-varying fields Electronegative discharges Pulsed power discharges Dual frequency discharges High-density rf sheaths and ion energy distributions Hysteresis and instabilities Helicon discharges Hollow cathode discharges Ionized physical vapor deposition Differential substrate charging With new chapters on dusty plasmas and the kinetic theory of discharges, graduate students and researchers in the field of plasma processing should find this new edition more valuable than ever. {\textcopyright} 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.},

abstract = {The secondary emission properties of the surface play one of the key roles in its interaction with plasma. This paper presents the first study of electron-induced electron emission yield performed in the linear plasma simulator BPD-PSI. To verify the applicability of the measurement technique used, a series of experiments was conducted to investigate the total secondary electron yield as a function of the energy of primary electrons for several pure elements, such as carbon, copper, and tungsten. Particular attention was paid to the latter as one of the essential plasma-facing materials, due to its ability to withstand moderate plasma loads. The change in the total secondary electron yield of tungsten was studied in-vacuo after each subsequent change in its surface morphology as a result of: annealing at 2770 K, exposure to pure helium plasma at 1250 K and annealing of plasma-modified tungsten surface at 2770 K. The growth of nanoscale structures, known as fuzz, on its surface caused a reduction in the total yield of secondary electrons by 10–18% compared to the clean surface. A non-monotonic relationship between total secondary electron yield and primary electron energy was observed. The interpretation of this phenomenon is given in the present work.}

@article{Gudmundsson2017,
abstract = {A typical dc discharge is configured with the negative cathode at one end and a positive anode at the other end, separated by a gas filled gap, placed inside a long glass cylinder. A few hundred volts between the cathode and anode is required to maintain the discharge. The type of discharge that is formed between the two electrodes depends upon the pressure of the working gas, the nature of the working gas, the applied voltage and the geometry of the discharge. We discuss the current-voltage characteristics of the discharge as well as the distinct structure that develops in the glow discharge region. The dc glow discharge appears in the discharge current range from $\mu$A to mA at 0.5-300 Pa pressure. We discuss the various phenomena observed in the dc glow discharge, including the cathode region, the positive column, and striations. The dc glow discharge is maintained by the emission of secondary electrons from the cathode target due to the bombardment of ions. For decades, the dc glow discharge has been used as a sputter source. Then it is often operated as an obstructed abnormal glow discharge and the required applied voltage is in the range 2-5 kV. Typically, the cathode target (the material to be deposited) is connected to a negative voltage supply (dc or rf) and the substrate holder faces the target. The relatively high operating pressure, in the range from 2 to 4 Pa, high applied voltages, and the necessity to have a conductive target limit the application of dc glow discharge as a sputter source. In order to lower the discharge voltage and expand the operation pressure range, the lifetime of the electrons in target vicinity is increased through applying magnetic field, by adding permanent magnets behind the cathode target. This arrangement is coined the magnetron sputtering discharge. The various configurations of the magnetron sputtering discharge and its applications are described. Furthermore, the use of dc discharges for chemical analysis, the Penning discharge and the hollow cathode discharges and some of its applications are briefly discussed.},

@techreport{Chu1992,
abstract = {This report contains information about the effect of frequency on the breakdown voltage of an air gap at standard pressure and temperature, 76 mm Hg and OOC, respectively. The frequencies of interest are 47 MHZ and 60 MHz. Additionally, the breakdown in vacuum is briefly considered. The breakdown mechanism is explained on the basis of collision and ionization. The presence of the positive ions produced by ionization enhances the field in the gap, and thus determines the breakdown. When a low-frequency voltage is applied across the gap, the breakdown mechanism is the same as that caused by the DC or static voltage. However, when the frequency exceeds the first critical valuef,, the positive ions are trapped in the gap, increasing the field considerably. This makes the breakdown occur earlier; in other words, the breakdown voltage is lowered. As the frequency increases two decades or more, the second critical frequency,f,,, is reached. This time the electrons start being trapped in the gap. Those electrons that travel multiple times across the gap before reaching the positive electrode result in an enormous number of electrons and positive ions beiig present in the gap. The result is a further decrease of the breakdown voltage. However, increasing the frequency does not decrease the breakdown voltage correspondingly. In fact, the associated breakdown field intensity is almost constant (about 29 kV/cm). The reason is that the recombination rate increases and counterbalances the production rate, thus reducing the effect of the positive ions' concentration in the gap. The theory of collision and ionization does not apply to the breakdown in vacuum. It seems that the breakdown in vacuum is primarily determined by the irregularities on the surfaces of the electrodes. Therefore, the effect of frequency on the breakdown, if any, is of secondary importance.},

Comparison with the theoretical behavior of downscaled plasma devices shows that the properties of the microplasma do not fundamentally differ from those of larger plasmas. Using the plasma as an excitation source, methane could be detected with a detection limit of 3 x 10-12 g/s (600 ppm), by observing the emission of the CH radical.

@article{Becker2006,
abstract = {Atmospheric-pressure, non-equilibrium plasmas are susceptible to instabilities and, in particular, to arcing (glow-to-arc transition). Spatially confining the plasma to dimensions of 1 mm or less is a promising approach to the generation and maintenance of stable, glow discharges at atmospheric-pressure. Often referred to as microdischarges or microplasmas, these weakly-ionized discharges represent a new and fascinating realm of plasma science, where issues such as the possible breakdown of 'pd scaling' and the role of boundary-dominated phenomena come to the fore. Microplasmas are generated under conditions that promote the efficient production of transient molecular species such as the rare gas excimers, which generally are formed by three-body collisions. Pulsed excitation on a sub-microsecond time scale results in microplasmas with significant shifts in both the temperatures and energy distribution functions associated with the ions and electrons. This allows for the selective production of chemically reactive species and opens the door to a wide range of new applications of microplasmas. The implementation of semiconductor and microelectronics and MEMs microfabrication techniques has resulted in the realization of microplasma arrays as large as 250,000 devices. Fabricated in silicon or ceramics with characteristic device dimensions as small as 10 $\nu$m and at packing densities up to 104 cm-2, these arrays offer optical and electrical characteristics well suited for applications in medical diagnostics, displays and environmental sensing. Several microplasma device structures, including their fundamental properties and selected applications, will be discussed. {\textcopyright} 2006 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {High-density radio-frequency (RF) plasma sources have been produced by ring-shaped hollow-cathode discharge at various trench shapes. The influence of hollow-cathode trench shape on high-density plasma production has been investigated at a wide range of argon gas pressure and various input powers. The trench shapes are selected from well-typed, taper-typed, step-typed, and three improved step-typed trench shapes. It is revealed that, at the lower pressure less than 200 mtorr, the plasma density for the well-typed shape is the highest among the three shapes, while for the step-typed shape, it is the lowest. For the higher pressure more than 200 mtorr, the plasma density for the step-typed shape has the highest value. The results indicate that the plasma density for all typed shapes is almost proportional to RF input power. It is found that the improved step-typed trench shapes can attain a wide range of gas pressure sustaining higher plasma density. {\textcopyright} 1973-2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {The hollow-cathode effect (HCE) is studied for conventional and modified hollow-cathode discharges (HCDs). HCDs are considered that operate at substantial current densities and moderate voltages (e.g. in a conventional HCD, >1 mA cm-2 and <400 V, respectively), which are typical of the HCDs in common use. A simple kinetic model is developed and used to predict that the HCE exists even if a small fraction of the total ionization occurs in the cathode-fall regions (CF). The HCE results from ionization becoming more efficient in the negative glow (NG) so that no significant ionization is required to occur in the CF. Consequently, the size of the CF diminishes and a large increase in current takes place. The main features of the HCE are reproduced and good agreement with experiment is found. The results suggest that low-slope-resistance voltage-current characteristics are realized when the ionization in the CF is small. It is next demonstrated that the ions play an important role and that even a small increase in the ion flux from the NG to the CF can contribute to the HCE. The principal geometrical criteria for the conventional and modified HCDs are presented. A segmented HCD tube is considered to study an interesting transition from a conventional HCD through a modified HCD to an abnormal glow discharge. Finally, the principal physical mechanisms which determine the operating characteristics of the modified HCD are identified and discussed.},

An operating mode in which the emitting plasma surface is deep in the emitting channel is optimal for obtaining the highest emission-current density. The beam diameter is reduced by a factor of 1.5–2.0 by choosing the operating mode of the plasma emitter. A two-lens focusing system is used to focus the electron beam. Studies have shown the possibility of generating beams with a power density five to seven times higher than that attained earlier in plasma-cathode guns. As a result of these studies, a plasma-cathode electron gun that allows generation of an electron beam with a diameter of ∼260 $\mu$m and a power of 3 kW at an accelerating voltage of 30 kV has been developed.},

The design offers the following benefits over thermionic cathode triode EB guns: much longer cathode lifetime and as a result improved reliability and reduced maintenance costs; no requirement for a grid electrode, avoiding beam aberration, and rapid beam pulsing. The construction of the diode gun was completed and the results of this paper demonstrate that the EB can be switched on in 200 ns and off within 800 ns. Electrons were extracted from a plasma chamber and then accelerated by an electric field applied in a vacuum chamber at a pressure of 10-5 to 10-6mbar, producing a collimated EB. The ionized gas used was air at some 0.5 mbar pressure. The EB gun has been operated at -60 kV accelerating potential and has produced beams of up to 3.2 kW power continuous wave. Modulation of the RF signal was used to control the beam power. Details of the design features of the plasma device are given and evidence of the advantages over conventional EB guns is provided through empirical results. {\textcopyright} 1963-2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {A self-consistent particle-in-cell simulation study is performed to investigate the effect of driving frequency on the electric field nonlinearity, electron heating mechanism, and electron energy distribution function (EEDF) in a low pressure symmetric capacitively coupled plasma (CCP) discharge at a constant electron plasma frequency maintained by adjusting the discharge voltage. The driving frequency is varied from 27.12 MHz to 100 MHz for a fixed discharge gap of 3.2 cm and at a gas pressure of 1 Pa. The simulation results provide insight into higher harmonic generations in a CCP system for a constant electron response time. The spatiooral evolution and spatial time-averaged electron heating are presented for different driving frequencies. The simulation results predict that the electric field nonlinearity increases with a rise in driving frequency along with a concurrent increase in higher harmonic contents. In addition to the electron heating and cooling near to the sheath edge, a positive <J.E> is observed into the bulk plasma at higher driving frequencies. The EEDF illustrates enhancement in the population of mid-energy range electrons as driving frequency increases thereby changing the shape of EEDF from bi-Maxwellian to nearly Maxwellian. For the constant ion flux on the electrode surface, a decrease in the ion energy by more than half is observed with an increase in driving frequency.},

This study was conducted to identify the long-haul travel motivation by international tourists to Penang. A total of 400 respondents participated in this survey, conducted around the tourist attractions in Penang, using cluster random sampling. However, only 370 questionnaires were only used for this research. Data were analysed using SPSS software 22 version. The findings, ‘knowledge and novelty seeking' were the main push factors that drove long-haul travel by international tourists to Penang. Meanwhile, the main pull factor that attracts long- haul travel by international tourists to Penang was its ‘culture and history'. Additionally, there were partly direct and significant relationships between socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation (push factors and pull factors). Overall, this study identified the long-haul travel motivations by international tourists to Penang based on socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation and has indirectly helped in understanding the long-haul travel market particularly for Penang and Southeast Asia. This research also suggested for an effective marketing and promotion strategy in pro- viding useful information that is the key to attract international tourists to travel long distances.

abstract = {Effects of driving frequency on the plasma density in capacitively coupled plasmas (CCPs) have been investigated at Torr-order pressures which are commonly used in film deposition processes (1 Torr = 133.322 Pa). Using a particle-in-cell, Monte Carlo collision model, frequency trends of the electron density have been simulated in Ar and H2/Ar CCPs from 300 kHz to 27 MHz. The results show a local maximum of the electron density at 450 kHz and a local minimum around 4 MHz in both the Ar and H2/Ar plasmas. In particular, in the H2/Ar plasma, 450 kHz is more effective to produce higher density plasma than 13.56 MHz at Torr-order pressure although it is generally believed that higher density plasma can be obtained as the driving frequency increases. The ion density starts to oscillate between electrodes around 4 MHz since it is close to the ion plasma frequency. Thus, the plasma bulk collapses resulting in the low plasma density. On the other hand, at 450 kHz, in addition to the gamma process, the re-formed plasma bulk contributes to high density plasma.},

abstract = {The change in electrode impedance of semiconductor equipment due to repetitive processes is a major issue that creates process drift. In the current plasma etch chamber with a dual-frequency power system, the high-powered radio frequency (RF) source contributes to the enhancement of the plasma density, and the low-frequency bias power at the bottom electrode is adopted to enhance the injected ion energy in the plasma. The impedance control of the top electrode in dual-frequency capacity coupled plasma limits the impedance matching capability of the RF matching system because it only considers the high-frequency RF source. To control the precise impedance in dual-frequency semiconductor equipment, independent impedance control is required for each frequency. In this study, the impedance corresponding to a specific frequency was independently controlled using L (inductor) and C (capacitor). A 60 MHz stop filter and VVC were used to control 2 MHz impedance at a specific point, and a 2 MHz stop filter and VVC were used to control 60 MHz impedance. In the case of 2 MHz impedance control, the 2 MHz impedance changed from 10.9−j893 to 0.3−j62 and the 60 MHz impedance did not change. When controlling the 60 MHz impedance, the 60 MHz impedance changed from 0.33 + j26.53 to 0.2 + j190 and the 2 MHz impedance did not change. The designed LC circuits cover the impedance of 60 and 2 MHz separately and are verified by the change in the capacitance of the vacuum variable capacitors implemented in the RF impedance matching system.},

abstract = {A modern trend of VHF driven plasma sources in semiconductor processing stimulates a lot of studies concerning the driving frequency effect on plasma parameters in a capacitive discharge. In spite of abundant studies, the validation and application of these results in industrial plasma processing are still questionable because these studies were performed under a fixed rf voltage condition or an assumption of Maxwellian electron energy distribution, while the fixed discharge power condition and non-Maxwellian distribution are typical in industrial plasma processing. To resolve this problem, the authors investigated the driving frequency effect on plasma parameters (electron density and temperature) under the fixed discharge power condition by measuring the electron energy distribution functions, which are the most important factor in chemical reactions during the plasma processing. A remarkable result was observed-as the driving frequency increases, the electron temperature increases and the electron density remains almost constant or decreases, which is opposite to what previous studies have suggested. This result can be tentatively explained as a result of an enhancement of collisional heating in the bulk plasma with driving frequency under the fixed discharge power condition. {\textcopyright} 2006 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {The aim of this work was to identify the different diffuse dielectric barrier discharges (DBDs) obtained in the same electrode configuration and in the same gas for an excitation frequency ranging from 50kHz to 9MHz. The gas mixture was argon with 133ppm of NH3. This Penning mixture is useful to obtain both low-frequency glow DBDs (GDBDs) and diffuse radio-frequency (RF) discharges. Electrical measurements and short exposure time photographs showed that whatever the frequency, a discharge free of micro-discharge was obtained. In the same configuration, the discharge was a GDBD up to 200kHz. For frequencies higher than 250kHz, the discharge behavior was that of a Townsend-like discharge associated with a maximum energy transfer close to the anode and a higher power (about twice that of the GDBD). The cathode fall formation was no longer observed during the discharge current increase because of ion trapping in the gas gap by the rapid electric field oscillations. In the same configuration, the alpha RF mode was observed from 1.3MHz. Gamma secondary electron emission gave way to electron acceleration by the cathode sheath formation. Bulk ionization was important due to the high electron collision rate at atmospheric pressure. One consequence of the transition from low-frequency to high-frequency discharge was a significant increase in the power (factor ≈30), which reached 35Wcm-3, while the breakdown voltage decreased from 900V to less than 200V. {\textcopyright} 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Dielectric barrier discharges (DBDs) are plasmas generated in configurations with an insulating (dielectric) material between the electrodes which is responsible for a self-pulsing operation. DBDs are a typical example of nonthermal atmospheric or normal pressure gas discharges. Initially used for the generation of ozone, they have opened up many other fields of application. Therefore DBDs are a relevant tool in current plasma technology as well as an object for fundamental studies. Another motivation for further research is the fact that so-called partial discharges in insulated high voltage systems are special types of DBDs. The breakdown processes, the formation of structures, and the role of surface processes are currently under investigation. This review is intended to give an update to the already existing literature on DBDs considering the research and development within the last two decades. The main principles and different modes of discharge generation are summarized. A collection of known as well as special electrode configurations and reactor designs will be presented. This shall demonstrate the different and broad possibilities, but also the similarities and common aspects of devices for different fields of applications explored within the last years. The main part is devoted to the progress on the investigation of different aspects of breakdown and plasma formation with the focus on single filaments or microdischarges. This includes a summary of the current knowledge on the electrical characterization of filamentary DBDs. In particular, the recent new insights on the elementary volume and surface memory mechanisms in these discharges will be discussed. An outlook for the forthcoming challenges on research and development will be given.},

In this chapter, we examine the basic physics of the production of microwave plasma from the discharge breakdown to plasma sustainment, together with various production techniques of microwave plasma from low-pressure surface wave plasma, electron cyclotron plasma to atmospheric pressure microwave plasmas. Recently, a solid-state-based microwave power source has been utilized as the power source of microwave plasmas as an alternative to conventional magnetron-type microwave power supplies. Benefits of the solid-state microwave power for the plasma source are explained by focusing on the controllability of the microwave phase of the solid-state microwave power source.},

@article{Pollak2007,
abstract = {Long plasma columns generated by high-frequency (HF) fields and extending over distances longer than the free-space wavelength of the applied electromagnetic (EM) field are of interest in various applications. A commonly used method to achieve such long plasma columns calls for the propagation of EM surface waves that use the plasma as their propagating medium. In such a case, the HF field applicator, called a wave launcher, is much shorter than the actual length of the plasma column. Long plasma columns can also be sustained by using field applicators that run along the full length of the discharge tube. Most such linear applicators rely on waveguide components. However, it is possible to use transverse electric magnetic planar-transmission-lines based on stripline technology to design efficient linear field applicators. Using such an approach, we have developed a new type of HF linear field applicator that operates on a relatively wide frequency range (typically, 200-2450 MHz). Comparison of the discharge that it generates with a surface-wave discharge (SWD) sustained under similar operating conditions shows that the discharge volume is larger than that obtained with a SWD at the same power level, hence a lower gas temperature and a plasma column more axially uniform, two valuable features for some applications. The contraction of these plasma columns is shown to occur at higher gas pressures than with SWDs. All these measurements are carried out in argon as the discharge gas. {\textcopyright} 2007 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

@article{Hopwood2004,
abstract = {The generation of plasma-on-a-chip is examined for two extremes in gas pressure. The application of microplasmas as sensors of industrial vacuum processes requires stable operation at gas pressures of less than 1 Pa. In this low-pressure regime, the addition of a static magnetic field that causes electron cyclotron resonance is shown to increase the emission intensity of the microplasma by 50%. Using atomic emission spectrometry, the detection of helium in air is found to have a detection limit of 1000 ppm, which is three orders of magnitude worse than the DL of SO2 in argon. The loss of sensitivity is traced to the high excitation energy threshold of He, and to the poor ionization efficiency inherent in an air plasma. At atmospheric pressure (105 Pa), a microdischarge is described that operates in a 25 µm-wide gap in a microstrip transmission line resonator operating at 900 MHz. The volume of the discharge is ∼10−7 cm3, and this allows an atmospheric air discharge to be initiated and sustained using less than 3 W of power.},

abstract = {This paper focuses on the power dissipation of a plasma torch used for an optical surface fabrication process. The process utilizes an inductively coupled plasma (ICP) torch that is equipped with a De-Laval nozzle for the delivery of a highly collimated plasma jet. The plasma torch makes use of a self-igniting coil and an intermediate co-axial tube made of alumina. The torch has a distinctive thermal and electrical response compared to regular ICP torches. In this study, the results of the power dissipation investigation reveal the true efficiency of the torch and discern its electrical response. By systematically measuring the coolant parameters (temperature change and flow rate), the power dissipation is extrapolated. The radio frequency power supply is set to 800 W, E mode, throughout the research presented in this study. The analytical results of power dissipation, derived from the experiments, show that 15.4% and 33.3% are dissipated by the nozzle and coil coolant channels, respectively. The experiments also enable the determination of the thermal time constant of the plasma torch for the entire range of RF power.},

In this paper, we present an overview of the principles, strengths and limitations of the three simulation models, including a brief history and the recent status of their development. The three modelling techniques are benchmarked by comparing simulation results in different plasma systems (plasma display panels, capacitively coupled plasmas and inductively coupled plasmas) with experimentally measured data.

abstract = {Many-particle (meaning 1000's) charged-particle plasma simulations using spatial meshes for the electromagnetic field solutions, particle-in-cell (PIC) merged with Monte Carlo collision (MCC) calculations, are coming into wide use for application to partially ionized gases. This paper emphasizes the development of PIC computer experiments since the 1950's starting with one-dimensional (1-D) charged. sheet models, the addition of the mesh, and fast direct Poisson equation solvers for 2-D and 3.D. The finite-size particle-in-mesh (finite $\Delta$x, $\Delta$t) theory of Langdon [51]─[53] is presented in part to display the effects of too small $\lambda$D/ $\Delta$ x, even for Maxwellian velocity distributions, as a caution, for example, when some ions are cooled to background gas temperatures by charge exchange. Early work on adding collisions to 1-D charge-sheet models by Burger [28] and Shanny et al. are presented, with many of the elements of current Monte Carlo codes. Bounded plasma modeling is presented with electrode charges and external R, L, C, and V(t), I(t) sources now in use on fast desktop computers as real-time computer experiments, complementing analytic modeling and laboratory experiments. The addition of Monte Carlo collisions (usually done with irregular timesteps) to PIC (usually done with uniform $\Delta$t's) is displayed as a developing art, relying on experimental total cross sections and approximate analytical differential cross sections to produce changes in charged-particle speed and direction due to collisions with neutrals, so far including elastic, excitation, ionization, charge exchange, and attachment processe. {\textcopyright} 1991 IEEE},

Important examples of this are the motion of stars in galaxies, ions in hot gas plasmas, electrons in semiconductor devices, and atoms in solids and liquids. The behavior of the system is studied by programming into the computer a model of the system and then performing experiments with this model. New scientific insight is obtained by observing such computer experiments, often for controlled conditions that are not accessible in the laboratory. Computer Simulation using Particles deals with the simulation of systems by following the motion of their constituent particles. This book provides an introduction to simulation using particles based on the NGP, CIC, and P3M algorithms and the programming principles that assist with the preparations of large simulation programs based on the OLYMPUS methodology. It also includes case study examples in the fields of astrophysics, plasmas, semiconductors, and ionic solids as well as more detailed mathematical treatment of the models, such as their errors, dispersion, and optimization.This resource will help you understand how engineering design can be assisted by the ability to predict performance using the computer model before embarking on costly and time-consuming manufacture.},

Our method can get the same result as usual methods by solving only one Partial Differential Equations (PDE) problem; it is superior to existing methods because it is faster and provides better coverage rates for occlusion regions than variation techniques when tested against a varied number of benchmark datasets.

abstract = {The object-oriented paradigm provides an opportunity for advanced PIC modeling, increased flexibility, and extensibility. Particle-in-cell codes for simulating plasmas are traditionally written in structured FORTRAN or C. This has resulted in large legacy codes which are difficult to maintain and extend with new models. In this ongoing research, we apply the object-oriented design technique to address these issues. The resulting code architecture, OOPIC (object-oriented particle-in-cell), is a two-dimensional relativistic electromagnetic PIC code. The object-oriented implementation of the algorithms is described, including an integral-form field solve, and a piecewise current deposition and particle position update. The architecture encapsulates key PIC algorithms and data into objects, simplifying extensions such as new boundary conditions and field algorithms. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

abstract = {An algorithm for coupling external circuit elements to be bounded two-dimensional electrostatic plasma simulation codes is developed. In general, the external circuit equations provide a mixture of Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions for the Poisson equation, which is solved each time step for the internal plasma potential. We rewrite the coupling between the plasma and the external circuit parameters as an algebraic or ordinary differential equation for the potential on the boundary. This scheme allows decomposition of the field solve into a Laplace solver with boundary conditions (e.g., applied potentials) and a Poisson solver with zero boundary conditions. We present the details of the external circuit coupling to an explicit electrostatic planar two-dimensional particle-in-cell code called PDP2, and discuss briefly how the coupling can be done in an implicit electrostatic code. The decomposition replaces the iterative coupling with a direct coupling and reduces the amount of computational time spent in the field solver. We use PDP2 to simulate a dually excited capacitively coupled RF discharge and show how such a system can be used as a plasma processing tool with separate control over ion flux and ion bombarding energy. {\textcopyright} 1997 Academic Press.},

abstract = {CO2 conversion into value-added chemicals and fuels is considered as one of the great challenges of the 21st century. Due to the limitations of the traditional thermal approaches, several novel technologies are being developed. One promising approach in this field, which has received little attention to date, is plasma technology. Its advantages include mild operating conditions, easy upscaling, and gas activation by energetic electrons instead of heat. This allows thermodynamically difficult reactions, such as CO2 splitting and the dry reformation of methane, to occur with reasonable energy cost. In this review, after exploring the traditional thermal approaches, we have provided a brief overview of the fierce competition between various novel approaches in a quest to find the most effective and efficient CO2 conversion technology. This is needed to critically assess whether plasma technology can be successful in an already crowded arena. The following questions need to be answered in this regard: are there key advantages to using plasma technology over other novel approaches, and if so, what is the flip side to the use of this technology? Can plasma technology be successful on its own, or can synergies be achieved by combining it with other technologies? To answer these specific questions and to evaluate the potentials and limitations of plasma technology in general, this review presents the current state-of-the-art and a critical assessment of plasma-based CO2 conversion, as well as the future challenges for its practical implementation.},

Not-thermal plasma, in combination with catalysis, is one of the possibilities to promote this reaction. Current studies on plasma-assisted CO2 splitting are limited mainly to the formation of CO. By combining data on the status of current studies on plasma CO2 splitting with those on CO2tC it is possible to propose a tentative novel approach. This is a conceptual idea presented and discussed as vehicle to stimulate research in the area, including proposing alternative possibilities.

By calculating the adsorption chemistry under CO oxidation conditions, we find that the Pt@Cu NPs will be active for CO oxidation with resistance to CO-poisoning. The CO oxidation pathway at the Pt-Cu interface is determined on the Pt NP covered with a full- and partial-shell of Cu. The exposed portion of the Pt core preferentially binds CO and the Cu shell binds O2, supplying oxygen for the reaction. The Pt-Cu interface provides CO-oxidation sites that are not poisoned by either CO or O2. Additional computational screening shows that this separation of reactant binding sites is possible for several other core@shell NPs. Our results indicate that the metal-metal interface within a single NP can be optimized for design of bifunctional catalytic systems with improved performance.},

The key point to CO2 conversion is the activation of either CO2 or co-reactant at different conditions. To bear this in mind, our strategy is to activate CO2 either with the presence of electron-rich chemicals or by hydrogen, and to convert CO2 with a coupling reaction in some case. In this way, catalytic conversion of CO2 has been carried out by different methodology at our lab, including CO2 reforming of methane to syngas production over bifunctional catalysis, CO2 hydrogenation for methanol synthesis by nano-structured catalyst, and synthesis of carbonates from sub- or super-critical CO2 with a coupling of in situ water removal reaction or bifunctional catalyst system.

Following a distribution law, the probability for the activation mechanism can be described by an Arrhenius-like equation. The potential of this approach is demonstrated on the basis of plasma polymerization and plasma CO2 conversion.

The spatial distribution of the power absorbed in the plasma is analyzed. It is also confirmed that the vibrational excitation is a key factor in the CO2 dissociation process in this type of plasma.

abstract = {This paper demonstrates that the CO2 conversion in a dielectric barrier discharge rises drastically upon addition of Ar or He, and the effect is more pronounced for Ar than for He. The effective CO2 conversion, on the other hand, drops upon addition of Ar or He, which is logical due to the lower CO2 content in the gas mixture, and the same is true for the energy efficiency, because a considerable fraction of the energy is then consumed into ionization/excitation of Ar or He atoms. The higher absolute CO2 conversion upon addition of Ar or He can be explained by studying in detail the Lissajous plots and the current profiles. The breakdown voltage is lower in the CO2/Ar and CO2/He mixtures, and the discharge gap is more filled with plasma, which enhances the possibility for CO2 conversion. The rates of electron impact excitation-dissociation of CO2, estimated from the electron densities and mean electron energies, are indeed higher in the CO2/Ar and (to a lower extent) in the CO2/He mixtures, compared to the pure CO2 plasma. Moreover, charge transfer between Ar+ or Ar2+ ions and CO2, followed by electron-ion dissociative recombination of the CO2+ ions, might also contribute to, or even be dominant for the CO2 dissociation.

abstract = {In this paper the electron density and temperature of atmospheric helium and argon plasmas operated under similar experimental conditions are compared. The conditions are chosen such that both plasmas are ionizing. It is found that a helium plasma has a higher electron temperature and a lower electron density than an equi-operational argon plasma, i.e. an argon plasma that is operated at the same external conditions. This is mainly caused by the higher excitation potential of the first excited state and the lower mass of helium, respectively. Due to these differences in electron density and temperature the densities of the helium ground state and of the excited states are much larger than their corresponding Saha equilibrium values for a wide range of conditions. The consequence of this is that the spectroscopic methods, which are used to determine the electron density and temperature, have a very limited validity region in the case of helium. For argon the deviations are much smaller so that these methods can often be applied safely.}

abstract = {Carbon dioxide was converted to synthesis gas (syngas) in a microwave plasma torch by methane reforming at atmospheric pressure. The microwave plasma torch converts CO2 + CH4 into synthesis gas. This study examined conversion rates as a function of gas temperature for dry methane reforming. The temperature of the torch flame is measured 6760 K by making use of optical spectroscopy. The CO2/CH4 reforming can be completely converted into synthesis gas (conversions: 68.4%, CO2; 96.8%, CH4) through their reforming reactions at a microwave power of 6 kW. When the reforming gas (CO2:CH4) mole ratio was 1:1, the resulting synthesis gas (H2:CO) mole ratio was 0.9:1.1. The H2 and CO mass yield rates increased to 0.24 kg/h and 1.86 kg/h, respectively. Also, the energy yield are 240 g/h and 41.4 g/kWh. The CO2 microwave plasma torch not only exhibited noteworthy results for CO2 reduction and syngas production, but the H2:CO mole ratio of the gas produced is easily controlled by adjusting the CO2:CH4 ratio during the feeding process.},

abstract = {Despite enormous potential for technological applications, fundamentals of stable non-equilibrium micro-plasmas at ambient pressure are still only partly understood. Micro-plasma jets are one sub-group of these plasma sources. For an understanding it is particularly important to analyse transport phenomena of energy and particles within and between the core and effluent of the discharge. The complexity of the problem requires the combination and correlation of various highly sophisticated diagnostics yielding different information with an extremely high temporal and spatial resolution. A specially designed rf microscale atmospheric pressure plasma jet ($\mu$-APPJ) provides excellent access for optical diagnostics to the discharge volume and the effluent region. This allows detailed investigations of the discharge dynamics and energy transport mechanisms from the discharge to the effluent. Here we present examples for diagnostics applicable to different regions and combine the results. The diagnostics applied are optical emission spectroscopy (OES) in the visible and ultraviolet and two-photon absorption laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy. By the latter spatially resolved absolutely calibrated density maps of atomic oxygen have been determined for the effluent. OES yields an insight into energy transport mechanisms from the core into the effluent. The first results of spatially and phase-resolved OES measurements of the discharge dynamics of the core are presented. {\textcopyright} 2008 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Biomedical applications of non-equilibrium atmospheric pressure plasmas have attracted intense interest in the past few years. Many plasma sources of diverse design have been proposed for these applications, but the relationship between source characteristics and application performance is not well-understood, and indeed many sources are poorly characterized. This circumstance is an impediment to progress in application development. A reference source with well-understood and highly reproducible characteristics may be an important tool in this context. Researchers around the world should be able to compare the characteristics of their own sources and also their results with this device. In this paper, we describe such a reference source, developed from the simple and robust micro-scaled atmospheric pressure plasma jet ($\mu$-APPJ) concept. This development occurred under the auspices of COST Action MP1101 'Biomedical Applications of Atmospheric Pressure Plasmas'. Gas contamination and power measurement are shown to be major causes of irreproducible results in earlier source designs. These problems are resolved in the reference source by refinement of the mechanical and electrical design and by specifying an operating protocol. These measures are shown to be absolutely necessary for reproducible operation. They include the integration of current and voltage probes into the jet. The usual combination of matching unit and power supply is replaced by an integrated LC power coupling circuit and a 5 W single frequency generator. The design specification and operating protocol for the reference source are being made freely available.},

Due to increasing concentrations in the atmosphere, carbon dioxide has, in recent times, been targeted for utilisation (Carbon Capture Utilisation and Storage, CCUS). In particular, the production of CO from CO 2 has been an area of intense interest, particularly since the CO can be utilized in Fischer–Tropsch synthesis. Herein we report that CO 2 can also be used as a source of atomic oxygen that is efficiently harvested and used as a waste-free terminal oxidant for the oxidation of alkenes to epoxides. Simultaneously, the process yields CO. Utilization of the atomic oxygen does not only generate a valuable product, but also prevents the recombination of O and CO, thus increasing the yield of CO for possible application in the synthesis of higher-order hydrocarbons. },

abstract = {In this paper, a microstrip split-ring resonator microwave-induced plasma source was developed and the effect of the resonator strip width on the microplasma properties was studied. The end-goal of this paper is to implement the resonator into an in-space micropropulsion system. We thus need to understand the behavior of the microplasma to optimize the thruster performance. A range of resonators with widths from 1.5 to 6 mm were designed to generate a microplasma in argon. Simulations of the electric fields were performed to determine the peak gap electric field. Single Langmuir probe measurements were taken at a pressure of 1 torr to obtain the plasma density and electron temperature. The microwave power was varied from 4.7 to 11.34 W (37-41 dBm). The simulations showed that with an increase in the microstrip width, the maximum electric field strength is obtained for the 3-mm-wide resonator. The electron temperature is also the highest for the 3-mm-wide resonator sitting at 5.6 eV with 11.34 W of power. However, the maximum plasma density was obtained for the 1.5-mm resonator, ∼ 1.6 × 1017/m3. There is an indirect relationship between the resonator electric field and the resulting microplasma properties. A theoretical analysis of a resonator-based miniature ion engine showed similar performance to the existing miniature ion engines.},

Portable operation, however, limits the amount of power and vacuum levels that can be employed in the plasma source. This paper describes the design and initial characterization of a low-power microwave plasma source based on a microstrip split-ring resonator that is capable of operating at pressures from 0.05 torr (6.7 Pa) up to one atmosphere. The plasma source's microstrip resonator operates at 900 MHz and presents a quality factor of Q = 335. Argon and air discharges can be self-started with less than 3 W in a relatively wide pressure range. An ion density of 1.3 × 1011 cm-3 in argon at 400 mtorr (53.3 Pa) can be created using only 0.5 W. Atmospheric discharges can be sustained with 0.5 W in argon. This low power allows for portable air-cooled operation. Continuous operation at atmospheric pressure for 24 h in argon at l W shows no measurable damage to the source.},

abstract = {The microstrip split-ring resonator (MSRR) microplasma source is analysed and characterized using a microwave model of the device. Throughout the discussion, experimental data for three MSRR designs are also presented. The model identifies the key parameters that control the performance of the device and results in the formulation of closed-form expressions useful for designing, analysing and comparing MSRR designs. Matching the microstrip characteristic impedance to the microplasma impedance is found to be a key factor in the performance of these devices and it can be even more critical than the quality factor of the ring resonator. Based on the model, average rf electric fields of up to 4 MV m-1 at 1 W of input power are estimated to be generated in a 45 $\nu$m gap device. Furthermore, the model is used to determine the plasma impedance and thereby obtain information on physical properties of the microdischarge. Electron densities of the order of 1014 cm -3 are estimated in a 1 W argon discharge at atmospheric pressure. Based on the values of the plasma impedance, it is also determined that up to 70% of the power input to the MSRR is coupled to the electrons in the microdischarge. {\textcopyright} 2005 IOP Publishing Ltd.},
